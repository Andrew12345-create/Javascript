Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is a top priority for this project.  We appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing any vulnerabilities you discover.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been addressed.
Create a new private security advisory on GitHub. You can do this by navigating to the "Security" tab of this repository and clicking "New security advisory". This allows you to report the vulnerability confidentially.
Provide as much detail as possible about the vulnerability, including:
A clear description of the issue
Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
Affected versions
Potential impact
We will acknowledge your report within 72 hours.
We aim to provide an update on the status of the vulnerability and our mitigation efforts within 7 days. The timeline for a fix will depend on the complexity of the issue.
We will credit you for your responsible disclosure in the release notes, unless you request otherwise.
If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work to release a patch as quickly as possible.  We will notify you when the patch is available.

If the vulnerability is declined, we will provide an explanation for our decision.  This might happen if the reported issue is not a vulnerability, is already known, or is outside the scope of our project.

Thank you for helping us keep this project secure!
